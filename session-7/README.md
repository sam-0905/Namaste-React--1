### In the previous session we have created a  `Header component`,`Body`,`Footer`. With that we have created  our Food Villa app.

### First we have learnt the types `Import` and `Export`
  There are two types `Import` and `Export`
  - Default
  - Named 
  -  * as obj

### And we have maked `File Structre ` and put our files in Componets file.
 - also we have created constant file separately to put all our Hardcode data init.

### Finally we have made `Search Bar` 
 - We have made a input box to search Restaurants .
 - For that we have made using `React Hooks`.
