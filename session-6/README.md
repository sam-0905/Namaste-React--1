# Chapter 06 - Expolring the world ðŸ“š

### In the previous session we have learned about `constants` or `configu` file. Also we studied about one of the most important Hook `useState Hook`.

### First we have learnt about 
  - Microservices
  - Monolith

### And we have seen a - `useEffect Hook` with `Dependency array`

`useEffect Hook` is javascript function provided by `react`. The useEffect Hook allows you to  `eliminate side effects` in your components. Some examples of side effects are: `fetching API data`, `directly updating the DOM`, and `setting up subscriptions or timers`, etc can be lead to unwarranted side-effects.
useEffect accepts `two arguments`, a `callback function` and a `dependency array`. The second argument is optional.

```
useEffect(() => {}, [])
```

### And we use live api to our restaurant list. Which we used inside `useEffect Hook`.
     
### And then we use `CORS` extension to handle CORS error.

- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources. CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a "pre-flight" request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request. In that pre-flight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request.


  ### And we have made `Search Bar` 
 - We have made a input box to search Restaurants .
 - For that we have made using `React Hooks`.
 - with `useState Hooks` we have made to wrok our input box.
 
 ### Also we created Login/Logout button with useState.
 
 ### Finally we use `shimmer` UI effect.
  `Shimmer UI`:A shimmer UI resembles the page's actual UI, so users will understand how quickly the web or mobile app will load even before the content has shown up.
